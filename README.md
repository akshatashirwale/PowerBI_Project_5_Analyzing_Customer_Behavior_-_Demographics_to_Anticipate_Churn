# 📉 Customer Churn Analysis Dashboard

> A visual and data-driven analysis of customer churn patterns across geography, credit types, and customer behavior

## 📌 Project Overview

This project presents a **Customer Churn Analysis Dashboard** built using **Power BI**, analyzing data from a bank's customer database to uncover trends and patterns in customer churn behavior.

It helps in identifying:
- Who is leaving the bank and why
- The influence of gender, geography, and credit score
- Key time periods with high churn
- How active membership and credit card ownership affect retention

The goal is to enable **better decision-making and customer retention strategies** by transforming raw data into actionable insights.
